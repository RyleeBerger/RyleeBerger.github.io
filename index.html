        The main sport I play is softball. I play two seasons a year, one in spring, and one in fall. I used to play catchter but this year I discovered I couldn't because A. the gear was to small for me (the shinguards only came up to below me knees) and B. becauase it hurt my legs to bend down. Now I play 3rd base. Because of my legs I am able to reach far for the ball and am able to tag people out on the steals. I strike out a lot but when I do hit I hit hard. I am constantly working on my swing on the bat and swinging my hips first to help me get mor power and speed in my hits. The only thing I don't get about softball is why it is called softball. The ball isn't soft at all, in fact its harder than a baseball. Maybe they should switch the names so softball is baseball and baseball is softball.

        The other sport I like to play is football. I've been on a few flag football teams and tried out for the school football team this year. I was the only girl of course. Unforchanetly I didn't make it beacuse I was a girl. Becasue of that I want to make a professional football leauge for woman. Think about it, every sport has a male and female professional leauges except football. Woman are just as capable as men at playing it and some are probaly better.

        One of my favorite pastimes is fishing. Considering I have no paitiece whatsoever this may be suprising. The magority of fish I catch are rainbow trout, regular trout, and if I'm lucky cutthrout trout. I mostly fish by attaching a lure to the end of a line, cast out and reel back in to imitae a little fish. I also fly fish which is harder but can be more rewarding. Last summer the biggest fish I caught was  20-30 inch fish. I probaly caught around 20-30 fish last summer. This summer I plan to catch a catfish, tarpon, shark, and many other species of fish.

        I love animals. I know that when I am older I will work in a job that has to deal with animals such as being a Game Warden, Zookeeper, or a owner of a sanctuary or zoo. My favorite animal is the wolf. They are so much smarter and amazing then people know. They are cominly portrayed as the villian in most movies but in relaity they are very intelligent and kind creatures not savage dumb beasts. I would like to create a webiste that can educate people about the truth about wolves someday in the future. I also like a lot of animals that other people hate like snakes, mice, spiders (except tiny ones). I also LOVE dogs. Some of my favorites are the Beligan Malions, German Shepered, Goldendoodles, Labs, and Retreivers.
